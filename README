Event-Driven Real-Time Data Processor with API Integration using Apache Spark, REST API, and Flask
In the fast-paced world of data processing, the ability to derive actionable insights in real-time is crucial for organizations across diverse domains. This repository guides you through constructing a robust, event-driven, real-time data processor that seamlessly integrates APIs using Apache Spark, REST API, and Flask. The focus is on empowering data engineers and developers to efficiently process streaming data while remaining responsive to external events.

Getting Started
To set the foundation for streamlined data processing, we start by establishing a Spark session and context. This provides the groundwork for capturing real-time simulated data, such as live share pricing, through a streaming DataFrame. The architecture is designed to be flexible, adapting to the dynamic nature of today's data landscape.

External API Data Integration
This repository guides you through the intricacies of API data retrieval, demonstrating how to seamlessly integrate external data sources into the streaming pipeline. The structured Spark DataFrame showcases its versatility in handling real-time data processing with integrated external API data.

RESTful API with Flask
Integral to our implementation is Flask, serving as the cornerstone for building a RESTful API. This API not only initiates real-time data processing but also facilitates interactions for managing streaming queries. The event-driven nature of the application comes to the forefront as we delve into the incorporation of external triggers, ensuring dynamic responsiveness to environmental changes.

Threading for Continuous Operation
Threading in Flask ensures continuous application operation, providing an interface for the seamless management of streaming queries. This architecture is designed for resilience and responsiveness to dynamic changes in the data environment.

Code Walkthrough
The exploration culminates in a code walkthrough, describing the roles and functionalities of each component. By the conclusion, readers will possess a good understanding of constructing an event-driven real-time data processor with API integration, ready to tackle the challenges of the contemporary, data-intensive landscape.
